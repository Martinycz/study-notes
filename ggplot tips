# Sort categorical columns in a geom_bar chart

## Problem

I was trying to draw a bar chart that shows the scores of a group of people in an ascendent order. Then I got a trouble.
Even if I tried to sort the data frame by the score variable, the order of the bars on the chart doesn't change. Why?

## Cause

It turned out that ggplot takes the order of the factor levels. Sorting the data won't work if the factor levels remain same.
A quick remedy is to use reorder() function to adjust the orders of the factorial variable. 

## Code Example

library("ggplot2")

name <- c("Tom","Jerry","Mary")
score <- c(68,45,92)
dat <- data.frame(name, score)

ggplot(data=dat, aes(name,score)) + geom_bar(stat="identity")     # initial display of the unordered data

# Now I am going to sort out the dat data by score
dat <- dat[order(dat$score),]
head(dat)                                                         # the data set has been reordered

# Execute ggplot again ... nothing happens
ggplot(data=dat, aes(name,score)) + geom_bar(stat="identity")

# As discovered, the levels of factorial variable have to be reordered
dat$name <- reorder(dat$name, dat$score)                          # this only changes of the order of factor levels but not data's

# Run ggplot to check the result. This time it works well.
ggplot(data=dat, aes(name,score)) + geom_bar(stat="identity")
